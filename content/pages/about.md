I’m currently involved in driving digital excellence in in the banking sector with Syncordis, a global, pure-play Temenos (core banking) services partner and service provider of regulated BaaS solutions and managed services. I also run an enrichment academy for kids in Singapore at [Pluto Academy](www.pluto.academy).

I love building companies, teams, and ideas. As a startup operator, what matters to me most is creating an engaging and fun learning journey, and empower children to do their best work and be their best selves. My professional interests include strategy & operations, media technology, design thinking, and emerging technologies. 

I’ve been lucky to lead a software development firm in Singapore from 2015 to 2019 — doing everything from Chief of Staff, Operations, Project Management, Marketing, and Business Development. Publications about me have appeared on [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/99-limit-breaking-female-founders-share-the-most_b\_5a580ad6e4b00b4ea8d08345), [Reader's Digest](https://www.rd.com/list/millennial-entrepreneurs/), [Women2.0](https://women2.com/2017/09/29/how-i-went-from-being-a-14-year-old-freelancer-to-a-tech-consulting-ceo/), [Thrive Global](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/female-disruptors-cherie-tan-is-helping-people-find-their-pathway-to-success/), and [BeamStart](https://beamstart.com/content/8202/Turning_her_Passion_for_Design_and_Programming_into_a_Profitable_Venture).
